Target：design a course in applied econometrics and causal inference for research with 3 units. 

It should cover all the reduced-form identification techniques, as well as micro-level causal inference framework. Structural estimation as well as machine learning will also be introduced. 

The course should span 12 weeks, and within each week it contains

- 2 lectures (*slide*, *lecture notes*): each lecture should take about 90 minutes;
- 1 tutorial (*tutorial guidance*): each tutorial should take 60-120 minutes;

- 1 assignment (*assignment* and *answer*);
- 1 reading list (in the *lecture notes*);
